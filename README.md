# Music Genre Classification

Music genre classification is a fascinating field that involves the use of machine learning algorithms to categorize audio tracks.It is one of the most complex tasks that involves time signal processing, time series, spectrograms, spectral coefficients, and audio feature extraction to feed a neural network. We use knn,svm and cnn for deep learning and we do spectrogram visualization.This project work satisfies the purpose of classify music in different genre.
